- What would you add to the inventory API to make it more useful?

 I would possibly adding a simply field of operating system and which version is running on the CPU. This will be able further filter the query. Using different qualifications. 


- What is another feature you would add to the client to help examine the current inventory?

The things that I would added is what I already included which was removing the limit of how many groups someone can overlap as well as adding a reverse argument to the API that would allow someone to see the bottom X amount of the group-resources.


- What other uses are there for this type of API in large-scale infrastructure?

It could be used for marketing towards a specific client within the API. If you wanted to sell more CPU memory than you could use a reverse function to find who has the least amount of memory and market towards them. 

- Ideas for further improvements youâ€™d make if given more time.

If given more time I would attempt to create a web application that uses the API and provides it to the user in a more user friendly and interactive design.
